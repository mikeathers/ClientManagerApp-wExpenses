Current project im working on for work.

Currently expenses like mileage and parking are tracked via an expenses A4 piece of paper you keep in your car where 
you add odometer values and total mileage or parking locations. 

At the end of each month you transfer all those details to an excel spreadsheet and send it over to accounts team with any receipts. 

A very tedious task, this application simplifies that task by being available via public facing web server. 
You can add odometer values into the new expense form or use the integrated google maps API if you forgot to take note of your odometer. 
Once an expense is added it can be updated. You can then add the origin of your journey and the current odometer reading and save that 
expense, then once you reach your destination you can go back into the expense and add the destination and final odometer reading. 
Using the google maps API, total mileage is calculated automatically and then the cost of the journey is automatically calculated. 

Datatables are used to view each monthly expense form and save them down as an excel spreadsheet, ready to be sent to the accounts team.
